## Project Overview

**Incoming Science** is a multi-user AI-powered daily arXiv digest system. It fetches papers from arXiv and top physics journals, grades them using a two-stage Claude pipeline (triage → scoring), generates a PDF digest with rating buttons, emails it to users, and uses collected ratings to refine each user's taste profile monthly.

The system runs as a cron job on a Hetzner VPS (`incomingscience.xyz`). Users rate papers via hyperlinks in the PDF that hit a Flask endpoint.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run full pipeline for all users
python run_all_users.py

# Run for a single user (testing)
python run_all_users.py --user <name>

# Skip email delivery (testing)
python run_all_users.py --user <name> --no-email

# Override date
python run_all_users.py --date 2026-03-19

# Skip journal scraping
python run_all_users.py --no-journals

# Skip Batch API (use direct API; fallback mode)
python run_all_users.py --user <name> --no-batch

# Monthly profile refiner
python run_all_users.py --refine
python run_all_users.py --refine --dry-run

# Onboard a new user (interactive)
python create_profile.py --user-dir users/<name>

# Run Flask rating server locally
python server.py
```

## Architecture

### Daily Pipeline (`run_all_users.py` → `run_daily.py` per user)

1. `deduplicate_ratings.py` — keep latest rating per paper per day
2. `archive.py` — append deduplicated ratings to `users/<name>/archive.json`
3. `fetch_papers.py` — fetch arXiv RSS → `today_papers.json`
4. `fetch_journals.py` — scrape 11 top journals → append to today_papers
5. `run_pipeline.py` — two-stage AI grading via Anthropic Batch API
6. `build_digest_pdf.py` — generate PDF with embedded rating hyperlinks
7. `send_email()` — email PDF to user
8. `cleanup_old_folders()` — delete `data/` folders older than 14 days

Users run in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

### AI Pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`)

Two-stage design using Anthropic Batch API (50% cost discount, async):

- **Triage** (Claude Haiku, `prompts/triage.txt`): Receives lean profile (keywords, areas, authors) + all ~80 papers. Classifies high/medium/low. Hard caps: max 15 arXiv + 15 journal papers forwarded.
- **Scoring** (Claude Sonnet, `prompts/scoring.txt`): Receives full profile + triage survivors. Outputs score 1–10 + one-line justification + tags.

On 1-hour batch timeout, auto-falls back to direct API and sends an alert email. Flag file `batch_fallback.json` is written when fallback occurs; `run_all_users.py` scans for these post-pipeline.

### User Data Layout

```
users/<name>/
├─ .env                    # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, EMAIL_TO
├─ taste_profile.json      # Evolving profile (keywords/areas/authors/liked_papers)
├─ archive.json            # Permanent append-only ratings history
└─ data/YYYY-MM-DD/
   ├─ today_papers.json    # All fetched papers (arXiv + journals)
   ├─ filtered_papers.json # Triage survivors
   ├─ scored_papers.json   # Final ranked output
   ├─ digest.pdf
   └─ ratings.json         # Ratings recorded today
```

### Journal Scrapers (`fetch_journals.py`)

Per-publisher scraper classes under `scrapers/`: `aps.py`, `nature.py`, `science.py`. Field configuration (which journals, categories, tag filters) lives in `fields.json`. Watermarks in `journal_watermarks.json` prevent re-fetching duplicates.

### Rating Endpoint (`server.py`)

Flask app with three routes:
- `GET /` — landing page
- `GET /rate?user=&date=&paper_id=&rating=&...` — records rating to `data/DATE/ratings.json`
- `GET /health` — health check

### Monthly Refiner (`run_profile_refiner.py`)

Runs on the 2nd of each month. Loads 30 days of archive, pre-classifies score/rating discrepancies into 5 buckets, calls Claude Sonnet Batch to recommend `taste_profile.json` grade adjustments (±1 grade/month cap). Appends to `evolved_interests` narrative.

## Key Design Principles

- **Agents are pure reasoning — no tools**: All I/O (file reads, API calls, data prep) is done in Python. Claude receives structured in-context data and returns structured JSON.
- **System prompt quality over agent complexity**: Prompt engineering is the primary lever for accuracy. Read and preserve the triage/scoring rules carefully.
- **Concrete-anchor triage**: Medium classification requires at least one explicit keyword/author/subcategory anchor. Pure thematic adjacency is disqualified (this is intentional, see `prompts/triage.txt`).
- **Lean profile for triage**: Only keywords, areas, and authors go to Haiku. Full profile (interests description, liked papers, evolved_interests) is reserved for Sonnet scoring.

## Environment Setup

Two `.env` files required:
- **Root `.env`**: `RATING_BASE_URL`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_SMTP_USER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`
- **Per-user `users/<name>/.env`**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_TO`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Production Infrastructure

- **VPS**: Hetzner CX23, Ubuntu 24.04, `116.203.255.222`
- **Web**: Caddy reverse proxy + HTTPS (Let's Encrypt) → Gunicorn (systemd)
- **Cron (TZ=Europe/Madrid)**:
  - Mon–Fri 05:30 UTC → daily pipeline
  - 2nd of month 06:30 UTC → monthly refiner
- **Logs**: `/var/log/arxiv-grader/daily.log`, `/var/log/arxiv-grader/refiner.log`

## Deploying to the Server

The server does **not** pull from git. Files must be copied manually via SCP:

```bash
scp <file1> <file2> root@116.203.255.222:/opt/arxiv-grader/
```

**Never SSH into the server or run the pipeline autonomously** — always provide commands for the user to run themselves.

## Known Constraints

- APS abstracts are truncated (RSS fallback only) — Hetzner IP is blocked by Cloudflare on APS full-text pages
- Monday arXiv feed has 120–165 papers (weekend accumulation) — triage caps handle this
- Science eTOC gives all papers from the last issue sharing the same date; watermark prevents duplicates on repeated runs
