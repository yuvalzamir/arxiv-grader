## Monitoring — how to check the logs

**Daily pipeline:**
```bash
scp root@116.203.255.222:/var/log/arxiv-grader/daily.log ./debugging/daily_log_MMDD.txt
```
Look for per-user `OK` / `FAILED` lines near the end, and `[TRIAGE]` / `[SCORE]` lines for rate-limit hits.

**Refiner (runs 2nd + 16th + new-user Saturday):**
```bash
scp root@116.203.255.222:/var/log/arxiv-grader/refiner.log ./debugging/refiner_log.txt
```
Key lines to check:
- `discrepancies: N total (overconfident-high=X, missed-excellent=Y, ...)` — one per user
- `Applying grade changes: ...` — what was actually changed
- `Pre-run grade-7 items` / `Removing grade-7` — keywords being pruned
- `Area management` lines — area grade changes from the Haiku step
- `Weekly-only delivery mode detected` — suppressed buckets for weekly-only users
- Any `ERROR` or `WARNING` lines indicate failures

**Weekly digest:**
```bash
scp root@116.203.255.222:/var/log/arxiv-grader/weekly.log ./debugging/weekly_log.txt
```

**Server (Flask/Gunicorn):**
```bash
scp root@116.203.255.222:/var/log/arxiv-grader/server.log ./debugging/server_log.txt
```

## Known rough edges (monitor, no action needed now)

- Cron changed to Mon–Fri 05:30 UTC (was Tue–Sat) — Friday arXiv data now delivered Monday
- On Mondays, arXiv feed has 120–165 papers due to weekend accumulation — triage cap of 15 handles this
- Scoring agent `max_tokens=16000` — sufficient for up to ~30 filtered papers (cap 15+15)
- Cron: system timezone set to `America/New_York` (`timedatectl set-timezone`); crontab runs at 00:30 ET daily, 01:30 ET monthly refiner — DST handled automatically
- Anthropic Batch API (Sonnet) can get stuck during incidents — use `--no-batch` flag as fallback

## Backlog

### Funding & sustainability
- [ ] **Sponsorship / small grant** (#42) — Apply for small grants (Sloan Foundation, NSF CAREER supplements, EU Open Science) to fund the service as public scientific infrastructure. No billing complexity, keeps it free for users. One grant typically covers 1–2 years of operating costs.

### Watermark bugs — journal re-fetch waste

Confirmed by server_backup_0602 analysis (consecutive-run DOI overlap). See [[Journal Scrapers]] for full details.

- [ ] **Science Advances same-day re-fetch** — ~37 `sciadv` papers per weekly issue repeat in all users' digests for one extra day. Same root cause as the PNAS bug (already fixed). Investigate `scrapers/science.py` — the skip-today filter may not be applied to Science Advances entries.

### Failure recovery
- [ ] **Watermark auto-restore on total field failure** (#2) — If every user in a field failed triage, automatically restore `journal_watermarks.json` from the per-run snapshot. Currently requires manual `cp` command. Rare but high-stakes when it happens.
- [ ] **Retry on truncated JSON in scoring** — On 2026-06-04 Yael's scoring failed because the Batch API returned truncated JSON mid-string in an `insights.relevance` field (output was 6153 tokens, well under the 16000 cap — transient API issue). `run_failed_users.py` auto-recovered. Consider adding a retry-on-parse-failure path in `run_pipeline.py`: if JSON parse fails and the response looks truncated (no closing `]`), retry once via direct API before giving up. Affects `paper_insights` users most (larger outputs).

### Adaptation speed
- [ ] **Topic-aware liked-paper selection for scoring** (#32) — Make `_sample_liked_papers()` select papers most semantically similar to today's triage survivors (keyword overlap in Python, no embeddings). Scoring agent sees few-shot examples most relevant to today's batch.

### Abstract coverage — CORE API fallback
- [ ] **CORE API abstract enrichment** — API key: `HyQYgNwRSCc0Mtix1Xv7rJof9lpmOAkF`. Add `_fetch_abstract_core(doi)` to `base.py` using `GET https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/works/doi:{doi}` with `Authorization: {key}` header. Returns `abstract` field for indexed OA papers. Add as third fallback in `TandfonlineScraper.scrape_article` (after OpenAlex, before S2 batch) and in `SageScraper`. Rate: 1,000 req/day registered — sufficient. Expected lift: ~5–10% on OA papers not yet in OpenAlex.

  **Relevant journals by field (all tandfonline publisher):**
  - `edu-policy`: JEdPolicy, ComparativeEdu, StudiesHigherEdu, OxfordReviewEdu, AssessmentInEdu
  - `econ-political`: PoliticalComm
  - `econ-education`: EduEconomics, JEconEducation, SchoolLeadership, JEdWork
  - `gender-studies`: GenderPlaceCulture
  - `literature-and-culture`: JModernJewishStudies, JewishCultureHistory

  Also relevant for Elsevier social-science journals with same Nov-2024 restriction (elsevier_general): EconEdReview, TeachingTeacherEdu, EarlyChildhoodResQ, IntJEdDevelopment, ComputersEdu (edu-policy field).

### Discovery
- Deferred to `docs/scaling_analysis.md` — need more users per field first.
