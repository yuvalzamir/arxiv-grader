## Triage tuning — DONE ✓

Created `prompts/triage_journals.txt` with abstract content signal (grade 1–5).
Caps: arXiv 20→15, journals 10→15. See `docs/journal_triage_tuning.md` for full log.

## `fetch_journals.py` — open issues

- [x] **4. Nature main wasteful scraping** — fixed: `d41586` DOI prefix filter in `NatureScraper.editorial_filter` drops news/views before page fetch. Saves ~45 unnecessary HTTP requests per run.
- [x] **5. Science RSS summary quality** — switched to eTOC feed (full last issue, 42 papers). Abstracts fetched via Semantic Scholar API (free, plain text). 20/42 papers get full abstracts; 22 editorial/opinion pieces fall back to short RSS summaries and are handled by triage.
- [x] **8. PRB publication lag** — not a lag; PRB simply didn't publish on March 25. Zero-paper days are normal and expected.
- [ ] **8b. Science date handling** — eTOC feed gives the full last issue; all 42 entries share the issue date (e.g. March 19). Date filter will return 0 on non-issue days. Need to decide: skip date filter for Science, or always include the most recent issue regardless of date.
- [x] **8b. Science date handling** — eTOC feed gives the full last issue; all entries share the issue date. Watermark handles this correctly — Science papers are picked up once per week when the new issue appears.
- [x] **8 (watermark)** — replaced fixed `--date` logic with per-journal watermark (`journal_watermarks.json`, keyed by RSS URL). Watermark advances to `min(max_entry_date, yesterday)` to prevent today's papers from being skipped tomorrow. `--since` flag overrides for manual re-runs without updating watermarks.
- [x] **1/6. Duplicate papers across feeds** — deduplication by `arxiv_id` added to `main()` in `fetch_journals.py` after all journals scraped.
- [x] **2. `import re` inside `_split_author_string()`** — already at module level in the rewrite.
- [x] **7. `requirements.txt`** — added `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml` (feedparser and requests were already present).

## Journal sources expansion (`journal_grader` branch)

Design documents: `docs/journal_sources_design.md` (architecture) and `docs/journal_implementation_plan.md` (step-by-step).

- [x] **1. `fields.json`** — complete. 10 journals (NanoLett deferred), section feeds for PRL, physical-sciences RSS for NatComms, eTOC feed for Science.

- [x] **2. `fetch_journals.py`** — complete. Publisher scraper classes (`scrapers/`), per-journal watermark, deduplication, Semantic Scholar for Science abstracts, 1.5s delay.

- [x] **3. `run_all_users.py`** — complete. Field discovery, single shared `fetch_journals.py` subprocess, `filter_for_field()` pure Python, per-user `--journals` arg, `--no-journals` flag.

- [x] **4. `run_pipeline.py`** — complete. `--journals` arg merges journal papers before triage (arXiv first). Separate triage batches with independent caps: arXiv 15, journals 15. `source` field added to `_paper_block()`.

- [ ] **5. `prompts/triage.txt`** — add SOURCE FIELD section
  - See exact text in `docs/journal_sources_design.md`

- [ ] **6. `prompts/scoring.txt`** — add SOURCE FIELD section + "top venue" tag
  - See exact text in `docs/journal_sources_design.md`

- [x] **7. `run_daily.py`** — complete. `--journals` accepted and forwarded to `run_pipeline.py` if file exists.

- [ ] **8. `build_digest_pdf.py`** — two fixes + source badge
  - Replace `arxiv_url()` with `paper_url()`: DOIs (`10.*`) → `https://doi.org/{doi}`, else arXiv URL
  - URL-encode `paper_id` in `rate_url()` using `urllib.parse.quote(paper_id, safe="")`
  - Add source badge (small pill, same row as score badge) for papers with `source` field

- [ ] **9. `requirements.txt`** — done. `environment.yml` does not exist; no action needed.

- [ ] **10. User profiles** — add `"field": "cond-mat"` to each existing `taste_profile.json`

- [x] **11. End-to-end test + deploy** — deployed 2026-03-27. See `docs/journal_triage_tuning.md`.
  pip installed on server: `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`, `matplotlib`. First live run tonight.

## Completed post-deploy (2026-03-27) ✓

- [x] **`run_pipeline.py` — archive NameError** — `run_scoring()` was referencing `archive` as a free variable; fixed by passing it as a parameter.
- [x] **`create_profile.py` — empty archive on onboarding** — creates `archive.json = []` alongside `taste_profile.json` on first save, so new users don't hit NameError on first run.
- [x] **`run_pipeline.py` — debug prompt files** — triage and scoring prompts (system + user) are written to `triage_arxiv_input.txt`, `triage_journals_input.txt`, `scoring_input.txt` in the data folder on every run.
- [x] **`run_pipeline.py` — `--no-batch` flag** — `_call_direct()` added; pass `--no-batch` to bypass Batch API queue and use synchronous messages API (2x cost, instant response). Threaded through `run_daily.py` and `run_all_users.py`.
- [x] **Batch API auto-fallback + alert email** — `BatchTimeoutError` raised after 1-hour timeout. Both triage and scoring catch it, retry with `_call_direct()`, and write `batch_fallback.json` to the data folder. `run_all_users.py` scans for these files after all users complete and sends an alert email to `yuval.zamir@icfo.eu` with per-user/per-stage report.

## APS abstract scraping — investigated 2026-03-27

Full investigation log in `docs/aps_cloudflare_proxy.md` (branch `APS_Scraping`).

- Semantic Scholar: no APS abstracts (licensing restriction — `abstract` is null even when paper is indexed)
- CrossRef: no APS abstracts (APS doesn't deposit them)
- OpenAlex: same — no abstracts for fresh APS papers
- Direct APS scrape: 403 on Hetzner IP (`link.aps.org` uses Cloudflare bot protection with JS challenge)
- Cloudflare Worker proxy: attempted but failed — APS itself runs Cloudflare, Worker fetch can't pass JS challenge
- **Resolution: accept truncated RSS abstracts** (~2–3 sentences, sufficient for triage). ICFO institutional APS access may help — check with library if APS whitelists IP ranges or provides API token.

---

## Pending

- [ ] **Shared data folder cleanup** — delete `data/YYYY-MM-DD/` daily after the run.
  The shared journal scrape folder (`BASE_DIR/data/`) accumulates one folder per day.
- [ ] **Journal triage tuning** — monitor first live run (2026-03-28 morning). Target 5–10 journals/day.
- [ ] **APS full abstracts** — check if ICFO has institutional APS access (IP whitelist or API token).

---

## Upcoming

- [ ] **April 2nd** — Check monthly profile refiner ran successfully (runs 2nd of month 06:30 UTC):
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/arxiv-grader/refiner.log
  cat /opt/arxiv-grader/users/yuval/taste_profile.json
  ```

## Known rough edges (monitor, no action needed now)

- Cron changed to Mon–Fri 05:30 UTC (was Tue–Sat) — Friday arXiv data now delivered Monday
- APS abstracts truncated (RSS fallback) — Hetzner IP blocked by APS Cloudflare protection
- On Mondays, arXiv feed has 120–165 papers due to weekend accumulation — triage cap of 15 handles this
- Scoring agent `max_tokens=8192` — sufficient for up to ~30 filtered papers (cap 15+15)
- Cron UTC offset: `TZ=Europe/Madrid` set in crontab — handles summer/winter time automatically
- Anthropic Batch API (Sonnet) can get stuck during incidents — use `--no-batch` flag as fallback
